            <p>
              Welcome, Iâ€™m <strong>Russell Nobles</strong>, owner of <strong>RN Construction</strong>. Our commercial team
              coordinates with owners and tenants so offices and retail spaces open on time. We plan around operations and
              communicate schedule impacts early.
            </p>

            <h2>What we deliver</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Office and retail interiors</li>
              <li>Lobby and common area upgrades</li>
              <li>Ground-up shells and core spaces</li>
              <li>Phased buildouts while areas stay open</li>
              <li>Night or weekend work to reduce downtime</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process and timeline</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assessment.</strong> We review the lease, existing conditions, and business needs.</li>
              <li><strong>Design and permits.</strong> Drawings, ADA checks, and permit tracking keep the project moving.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction.</strong> Trades are sequenced to minimize interference with operations.</li>
              <li><strong>Closeout.</strong> Final inspections, punch lists, and turnover documents are completed quickly.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Timelines vary by jurisdiction, scope, and lead times. We confirm the schedule after design and permitting
              milestones and keep you updated throughout.
            </p>

            <h2>Permits, compliance, and coordination</h2>
            <p>
              Commercial work must meet ADA, fire and life safety, and tenant improvement requirements. We coordinate MEP
              engineers, handle inspections, and link the effort with our
              <a href="/capabilities#design-build">Design-Build</a>,
              <a href="/capabilities#ti">Tenant Improvements</a>, and
              <a href="/capabilities#ground-up">Ground-Up</a> services.
            </p>

            <h2>Budget guidance</h2>
            <p>
              We offer preliminary pricing after reviewing plans and walking the space. Detailed budgets follow once finishes and
              vendor quotes are finalized.
            </p>
