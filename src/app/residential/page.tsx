            <h2>Process and timeline</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assessment.</strong> We start with a site visit to review goals and existing conditions.</li>
              <li><strong>Design and permits.</strong> Plans are refined and permits are handled so work is approved before we begin.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction.</strong> Trades are scheduled in a logical sequence and inspected for quality.</li>
              <li><strong>Closeout.</strong> We walk the project with you, address punch items, and deliver warranties.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Timelines vary by jurisdiction, scope, and lead times. We confirm the schedule after design and permitting
              milestones and keep you updated throughout.
            </p>

            <h2>Permits, compliance, and coordination</h2>
            <p>
              Residential work requires local permits, energy calculations under Title 24, and a sequence of inspections.
              Our team coordinates each step and ties it to our <a href="/capabilities#design-build">Design-Build</a> and
              <a href="/capabilities#remodels">Remodels</a> capabilities. For new structures we also connect you to our
              <a href="/capabilities#ground-up">Ground-Up</a> resources.
            </p>

            <h2>Budget guidance</h2>
            <p>
              After a walkthrough and a look at any plans, we provide a range that reflects current pricing. Final budgets
              come together once selections are made and subcontractor numbers are confirmed.
            </p>
