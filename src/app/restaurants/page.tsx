            <p>
              Welcome, Iâ€™m <strong>Russell Nobles</strong>, owner of <strong>RN Construction</strong>. Restaurants move fast,
              so we coordinate with your design team and equipment vendors to keep approvals and installation aligned. Our goal
              is a smooth opening day.
            </p>

            <h2>What we deliver</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Dining room and bar buildouts</li>
              <li>Back-of-house kitchen spaces</li>
              <li>Custom finishes and millwork</li>
              <li>Restroom and accessibility upgrades</li>
              <li>Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing coordination</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process and timeline</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assessment.</strong> We walk the site, review health requirements, and map vendor responsibilities.</li>
              <li><strong>Design and permits.</strong> Hood plans, grease systems, and ADA details are submitted for approval.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction.</strong> Trades work in sequence so equipment and finishes install without conflict.</li>
              <li><strong>Closeout.</strong> Final inspections are scheduled and we assist with punch work before opening.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Timelines vary by jurisdiction, scope, and lead times. We confirm the schedule after design and permitting
              milestones and keep you updated throughout.
            </p>

            <h2>Permits, compliance, and coordination</h2>
            <p>
              Restaurant projects involve health department approvals, ventilation and hood requirements, grease management,
              and ADA compliance. We coordinate these tasks alongside our <a href="/capabilities#ti">Tenant Improvements</a> and
              <a href="/capabilities#remodels">Remodels</a> services so design and inspections stay in sync.
            </p>

            <h2>Budget guidance</h2>
            <p>
              We provide a cost range after reviewing plans and equipment lists. Final pricing depends on finishes and vendor
              selections, which we confirm before buildout starts.
            </p>
