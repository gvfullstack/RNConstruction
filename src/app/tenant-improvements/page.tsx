            <p>
              Welcome, Iâ€™m <strong>Russell Nobles</strong>, owner of <strong>RN Construction</strong>. We build tenant spaces
              with respect for neighbors and building rules. Our team coordinates with property managers and keeps dust and
              noise under control.
            </p>

            <h2>What we deliver</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Office, retail, and medical buildouts</li>
              <li>Demolition and partitions</li>
              <li>Ceilings and lighting</li>
              <li>Flooring and finish packages</li>
              <li>Landlord coordination and documentation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process and timeline</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assessment.</strong> We review the lease and existing systems and confirm building rules.</li>
              <li><strong>Design and permits.</strong> Plans, ADA checks, and fire/life safety reviews move forward.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction.</strong> We schedule trades, protect common areas, and keep a clean site.</li>
              <li><strong>Closeout.</strong> Inspections, punch lists, and tenant manuals are wrapped up for turnover.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Timelines vary by jurisdiction, scope, and lead times. We confirm the schedule after design and permitting
              milestones and keep you updated throughout.
            </p>

            <h2>Permits, compliance, and coordination</h2>
            <p>
              Tenant work must meet ADA, fire and life safety, and often acoustical requirements. We manage permits and set up
              barriers and negative air if needed. This work draws on our <a href="/capabilities#ti">Tenant Improvements</a>
              and <a href="/capabilities#remodels">Remodels</a> capabilities.
            </p>

            <h2>Budget guidance</h2>
            <p>
              We assemble pricing after a walkthrough and review of plans. Allowances for finishes are clarified early so you
              know where choices can affect cost.
            </p>
