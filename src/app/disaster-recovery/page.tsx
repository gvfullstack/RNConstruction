            <p>
              Welcome, Iâ€™m <strong>Russell Nobles</strong>, owner of <strong>RN Construction</strong>. When disaster strikes,
              we step in early to stabilize the site, document the damage, and guide you through each decision. We coordinate
              with adjusters and keep you informed as we rebuild.
            </p>

            <h2>What we deliver</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Damage assessment and scope of loss review</li>
              <li>Selective demolition and debris removal</li>
              <li>Structural framing and mechanical rebuilds</li>

            <h2>Process and timeline</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assessment.</strong> We document damage, meet adjusters, and secure the site.</li>
              <li><strong>Design and permits.</strong> Plans and engineering are completed and permits secured.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction.</strong> Framing, utilities, and finishes are restored with regular inspections.</li>
              <li><strong>Closeout.</strong> Final walkthroughs, documentation, and warranties are provided.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Timelines vary by jurisdiction, scope, and lead times. We confirm the schedule after design and permitting
              milestones and keep you updated throughout.
            </p>

            <h2>Permits, compliance, and coordination</h2>
            <p>
              Recovery work often involves engineers, environmental testing, and insurer approvals. We manage these steps and
              draw on our <a href="/capabilities#ground-up">Ground-Up</a> and
              <a href="/capabilities#design-build">Design-Build</a> capabilities to bring structures back to life.
            </p>

            <h2>Budget guidance</h2>
            <p>
              Budgets are based on adjuster estimates and our own takeoffs. We clarify what insurance covers and what is an
              owner upgrade before work begins.
            </p>
