            <p>
              Welcome, Iâ€™m <strong>Russell Nobles</strong>, owner of <strong>RN Construction</strong>. In multifamily and HOA
              communities, we work with managers and boards to plan schedules, communicate clearly, and keep residents safe
              while improvements take place.
            </p>

            <h2>What we deliver</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Unit turns and refreshes</li>
              <li>Common area improvements</li>
              <li>Exterior repairs and waterproofing</li>
              <li>Safety fencing and lighting</li>
              <li>Small site and grading repairs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Process and timeline</h2>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Assessment.</strong> We meet with management, walk the property, and note resident impacts.</li>
              <li><strong>Design and permits.</strong> Plans, notices, and approvals are prepared before work begins.</li>
              <li><strong>Construction.</strong> Crews work building by building with clear signage and staging.</li>
              <li><strong>Closeout.</strong> Punch items and warranties are documented and delivered to the board.</li>
            </ol>
            <p className="text-gray-600">
              Timelines vary by jurisdiction, scope, and lead times. We confirm the schedule after design and permitting
              milestones and keep you updated throughout.
            </p>

            <h2>Permits, compliance, and coordination</h2>
            <p>
              Occupied properties require clear notices, safe access, and coordination with inspectors. We plan staging areas
              and inspection windows and tie this work to our
              <a href="/capabilities#remodels">Remodels</a>,
              <a href="/capabilities#outdoor">Outdoor</a>, and
              <a href="/capabilities#grading">Grading</a> capabilities as needed.
            </p>

            <h2>Budget guidance</h2>
            <p>
              We prepare estimates after a property walk and review of scope. Boards see line items and allowances so decisions
              are made with full cost visibility.
            </p>
